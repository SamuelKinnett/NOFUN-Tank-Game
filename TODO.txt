- Do we need an event queue?
	Could allow independent development of e.g. tanks and main
	If so - can we have it on it's on thread asynchronous from other objects?
	
- Implement more precise collision box
	axis aligned bounding box is enough for rough checking

- Make tanks have a mesh for more detail (GL_TRIANGLE_FAN)

- Prepare tanks for textures

- Do we need subclasses from tanks for TD/Heavy/Med/Light?
