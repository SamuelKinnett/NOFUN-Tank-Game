- Implement more precise collision box
	axis aligned bounding box is enough for rough checking

- Make tanks have a mesh for more detail (GL_TRIANGLE_FAN)

- Prepare tanks for textures

- Do we need subclasses from tanks for TD/Heavy/Med/Light?

- Modules class
	Gun, Tracks, Radio, AmmoRack, Engine

- Improve movement:
	different gear ratios
	base acceleration on rpm
	make acceleration decrease as high RPM is reached
	separate movement from main tanks
	make each track move individually
	realistically simulate turning (one track moves slower)
